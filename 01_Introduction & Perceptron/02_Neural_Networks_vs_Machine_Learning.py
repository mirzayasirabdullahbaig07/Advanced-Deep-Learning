# üß† Neural Networks vs Machine Learning
# ==============================================================

# Traditional Machine Learning:
# ------------------------------
# - Machine Learning (ML) algorithms learn patterns from data using
#   statistical methods and predefined features.
# - The learning process depends heavily on **manual feature engineering**.
# - Example algorithms:
#   - Linear Regression
#   - Decision Trees
#   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
#   - Random Forests
#
# Neural Networks (Deep Learning):
# --------------------------------
# - Neural Networks are a subset of Machine Learning inspired by
#   how the human brain processes information.
# - They automatically learn **features** from raw data through
#   multiple hidden layers of interconnected neurons.
# - They excel in solving **complex, high-dimensional problems**
#   such as image recognition, language translation, and speech synthesis.
#
# Key Difference Summary:

# Aspect              | Machine Learning        | Neural Networks / Deep Learning
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Feature Extraction   | Manual (by humans)      | Automatic (learned by network)
# Data Requirement     | Works on small datasets | Needs large datasets
# Computation Power    | CPU-based               | GPU/TPU required
# Training Time        | Fast                    | Slower (can take weeks)
# Interpretability     | Easier                  | Harder ("black box")

# --------------------------------------
# - Specialized for image and video data.
# - Uses convolutional layers to automatically detect patterns (edges, textures, shapes).
# - Commonly used in:
#     - Face recognition
#     - Object detection
#     - Medical imaging

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ RNN ‚Äî Recurrent Neural Network
# -----------------------------------
# - Designed for **sequential data** (e.g., time series, speech, or text).
# - Has memory connections that remember previous inputs.
# - Variants include:
#     - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
#     - GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
# - Applications:
#     - Language modeling
#     - Text generation
