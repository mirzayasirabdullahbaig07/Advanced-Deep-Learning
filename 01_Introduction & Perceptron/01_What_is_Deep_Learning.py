# üß† What is Deep Learning?
# ==============================================================

# Deep Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
# inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain.
#
# Deep learning algorithms aim to mimic how humans learn and make decisions ‚Äî
# by continuously analyzing data and improving performance using neural networks.

# While most machine learning algorithms rely on statistical techniques,
# deep learning uses a logical approach based on **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**.
# A collection of these interconnected neural networks forms the foundation of deep learning.


# ==============================================================
# üß© Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
# ==============================================================

# An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is the core of deep learning.
# It consists of multiple interconnected layers of nodes (neurons or perceptrons).

# üîπ Perceptrons (neurons): Represented as small circles in a network diagram.
# üîπ Connections (weights): Represent the strength of influence between neurons.
# üîπ Layers:
#     - Input Layer: Receives the raw input data.
#     - Hidden Layers: Perform computations and extract features.
#     - Output Layer: Produces the final result or prediction.

# The presence of multiple hidden layers makes the network "deep",
# which is why it‚Äôs called **Deep Learning**.

# üåü Why is Deep Learning So Popular?
# ==============================================================

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Applicability ‚Üí Deep Learning can be applied in almost every domain:
#     - Computer Vision (face detection, self-driving cars)
#     - Natural Language Processing (translation, chatbots)
#     - Speech Recognition, Healthcare, Finance, etc.
#
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Performance ‚Üí Deep Learning models often outperform traditional ML models
#     when provided with enough data and computational power.


# ==============================================================
# ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Definition
# ==============================================================

# Deep Learning is part of a broader family of Machine Learning methods
# based on **Artificial Neural Networks** with **Representation Learning**.

# Deep learning algorithms use multiple layers to progressively extract
# higher-level features from raw input data.
#
# Example (in image processing):
#     - Lower layers may detect edges.
#     - Middle layers may detect shapes or textures.
#     - Higher layers may detect objects or faces.


# ==============================================================
# üß© What is Representation Learning?
# ==============================================================

# Representation Learning is a set of techniques that enable a system
# to automatically discover useful features or representations from raw data,
# eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.

# It allows the machine to:
#     - Learn the features
#     - Use them directly for tasks like classification or prediction

# ü§ñ Deep Learning vs Machine Learning
# ==============================================================

# Category          Machine Learning                 Deep Learning
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Data Dependency   Performs well with small data     Requires large data
# Hardware          Works on CPU                      Needs GPU/TPU
# Training Time     Short                             Long (weeks/months)
# Feature Selection Manual (by humans)                Automatic (learned)
# Interpretability  Easier to interpret               Harder to interpret

# üëâ Summary:
# - For small datasets ‚Üí Machine Learning performs better.
# - For large datasets ‚Üí Deep Learning outperforms ML models.
# - Deep Learning performance improves as data increases ("data hungry").


# ==============================================================
# üíª Why Deep Learning is Thriving Now
# ==============================================================

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Availability of massive datasets (from social media, IoT, etc.)
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ High-speed internet and mobile device usage ‚Üí huge data generation
